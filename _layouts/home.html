<p>Hi! I’m Zheng, currently a Ph.D. student at UC Santa Barbara, supervised by Prof. <a
        href="https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~lingqi/" target="_blank">Lingqi Yan</a>. I received my Master’s and Bachelor’s
    degree at Shandong University, supervised by Prof. <a href="http://vr.sdu.edu.cn/info/1010/1060.htm"
        target="_blank">Lu Wang</a> and Prof. <a href="http://vr.sdu.edu.cn/info/1010/1062.htm" target="_blank">Yanning
        Xu</a>. I’m also very proud of being remotely advised by Prof. <a href="https://wangningbei.github.io/"
        target="_blank">Beibei Wang</a>.
</p>

<p>My research mainly focuses on rendering and material appearance. I believe that rendering is <strong>not</strong>
    solved (mainly because of having learned <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1my4y1z76s?p=3&amp;t=8m30s"
        target="_blank">this</a>), and there is still something interesting and challenging we can do.

<p>
    As my favorite quote from <a href="https://casual-effects.com/morgan/index.html" target="_blank">Morgan McGuire</a>
    goes, <em>good scientists do not just have good ideas, they also iterate through the mediocre ones very quickly to
        get them out of the way</em>. In the process of time, I can gradually infer the important traits in research
    from this quote, including <strong>passion</strong>, <strong>curiosity</strong>, <strong>quick-learning</strong>,
    <strong>tenacity</strong>, and <strong>perseverance</strong>. In practice, I constantly examine whether I have had
    these qualities and discipline myself to develop them.
</p>

<p>
    To the best of my knowledge, research can be hard, challenging, and discouraging; we sometimes have to work alone,
    facing consecutive failures, contending tediousness with passion and curiosity continuously. However, for me,
    research is also exceedingly fulfilling and highly rewarding. I can get tremendous satisfaction from expanding the
    boundary of human knowledge and collaborating with top-class intelligent researchers.

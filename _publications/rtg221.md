## Abstract

We present temporally reliable motion vectors that aim at deeper exploration of temporal coherence, especially for the generally believed difficult applications on shadows, glossy reflections, and occlusions. We show that our temporally reliable motion vectors produce significantly more robust temporal results than current traditional motion vectors while introducing negligible overhead.

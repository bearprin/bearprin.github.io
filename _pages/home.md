I am passionate about iteratively optimizing my scientific workflow and toolchain. I plan to summarize them into post later this year. For now, you can first check some tools I found useful in my workflow:

* Personal Knowledge Base (Note Making): [Heptabase](https://heptabase.com/){:target="_blank"}
* Meeting note taking: [Notability](https://notability.com/){:target="_blank"} with iPad
* Scientific log taking: [Logseq](https://logseq.com/){:target="_blank"}
* Paper Organization and Reading: [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/){:target="_blank"}

I am also actively collecting related resources in [teach-yourself-research](https://github.com/zheng95z/teach-yourself-research){:target="_blank"} for developing basic research skills.
